# odin-recipes
A basic website containing a list of a few of my favorite recipes.

This project will consist of an index page that has a list of three recipes,
each one linking to a recipe page that will contain the ingredients and steps
needed to make it, along with a picture of the completed product.

This project will demonstrate an understanding of basic HTML skills,
such as creating unordered lists, inserting images onto a web page,
and crating relative links to other pages on the website.
